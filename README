This project was mainly used to help us to learn Git and how to use 
it for a project. This project is made using code that I wrote for 
CS 121. It pushes integers ontothe stack and then removes them from the
stack.

Kevin Dorscher has added an array to hold the pop order, reverse order, of the stack, and a function
that will print the array elements.

Paul has just figured out how to edit the README file on GitHub.
